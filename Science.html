                    <h3>In this project I made a amusement park with organelles of a plant cell. In this project I learn
                        what is parts of a plant cell and a animal cell. I also learn the organelles functions. The
                        thing that I most struggled on was what part of the amusement park resembled the organelle. The
                        thing that was easy in this project was indestanding the functions of the organelles. </h3>

                        use a microscope. I also to use the microscope to look at lake water and pond water. In the
                        picture on the top left I saw a worm in the pond water. The difficlut part was trying to find
                        interesting stuff in the pond water. In this project I had a lot of fun. </h3>
