                    <h3>I made chess pieces in TinkerCad. The chess pieces that I made was a
                        Pawn and a bishop. TinkerCad is 3D modeling software. In this project I used good measurements.
                        The struggle I had in this project
                        was making to top of the chess piece because I had to make a lot of holes the cut off. </h3>

                        just had to to a change the angle 180 degrees. The hard part was making the worm in TinkerCad.
                        The hinge was the most difficult to make. The other proplem was that when we printed the worm
                        the worm was so small. Next time if I do it again I would change the size of the worm.</h3>

                        little bumps and I made a vex bridge. When all of the groups finish we put everything
                        together and made I big obstcle course. Then the teacher said we had to code the sphero. In
                        this project I learned that it is easier to code the sphero by measure the distance.</h3>
